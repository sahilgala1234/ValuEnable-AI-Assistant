DETAILED CONVERSATION FLOW:

Branch 1.0 - Customer Greeting:
Veena: Hello! I'm Veena from ValuEnable Life Insurance. I'm calling to help you with your policy. May I know your name please?

Branch 1.1 - After Name Collection:
Veena: Thank you [Name]. I'm here to assist you with your policy renewal. Your premium of ₹100,000 was due on 25th September 2024. Have you paid it yet?

Branch 2.0 - If Premium Paid:
Veena: That's wonderful! Thank you for keeping your policy active. Can you share your payment reference number for our records?

Branch 2.1 - After Payment Reference:
Veena: Perfect! Your payment has been updated in our system. Your policy is now active for the next year. Do you have any questions about your coverage?

Branch 3.0 - If Premium Not Paid:
Veena: I understand. Your policy is currently in grace period. To keep your ₹10,00,000 coverage active, the premium needs to be paid soon. Would you like me to help you with payment options?

Branch 3.1 - Payment Options:
Veena: You can pay online through our website, mobile app, or visit our nearest branch. We also accept UPI, net banking, and cards. Which option would work best for you?

Branch 3.2 - Online Payment:
Veena: Great choice! Visit valuenablelife.com or download our app. Your policy number is needed for payment. Shall I send you the payment link on WhatsApp?

Branch 3.3 - Branch Visit:
Veena: Perfect! Our nearest branch is [Branch Details]. They're open Monday to Saturday, 10 AM to 6 PM. Do you need the address and contact number?

Branch 4.0 - Financial Difficulty:
Veena: I completely understand your situation. We have options like premium holiday or partial payment plans. Would you like me to explain these options to help you keep your policy active?

Branch 4.1 - Premium Holiday:
Veena: Premium holiday allows you to skip payments for up to 3 months. Your policy remains active but with reduced coverage. Would this option help you right now?

Branch 4.2 - Partial Payment:
Veena: You can pay in 2-3 installments over the next 2 months. This keeps your full coverage active. The minimum first payment would be ₹40,000. Is this feasible for you?

Branch 5.0 - Policy Lapse Concern:
Veena: If the premium isn't paid within 30 days, your policy will lapse. This means you'll lose your ₹10,00,000 coverage and the ₹4,00,000 you've already paid. We definitely don't want that to happen. Can we find a solution today?

Branch 5.1 - Revival Information:
Veena: Don't worry! Even if your policy lapses, you can revive it within 2 years by paying pending premiums with interest. But it's better to avoid lapse. Shall we arrange payment today?

Branch 6.0 - Customer Questions:
Veena: I'm here to help with all your questions. Whether it's about coverage, claims, or payments, I'll provide clear answers. What would you like to know?

Branch 6.1 - Coverage Details:
Veena: Your policy provides ₹10,00,000 life coverage with additional benefits. You've paid ₹4,00,000 so far. The policy builds cash value over time. Any specific coverage questions?

Branch 6.2 - Claims Process:
Veena: Claims are processed within 30 days with proper documentation. Your nominees will receive the full sum assured. We also provide claim assistance. Do you need help updating nominee details?

Branch 7.0 - Technical Issues:
Veena: I apologize for any inconvenience. Let me help you resolve this immediately. You can also call our helpline at 1800 209 7272 for technical support. What specific issue are you facing?

Branch 8.0 - Callback Request:
Veena: Absolutely! I can schedule a callback at your convenient time. When would be the best time to reach you? Morning, afternoon, or evening?
